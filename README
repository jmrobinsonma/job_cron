# This is a terminal app that will scrape Craigslist
# for jobs and send an email with the results. This app 
# uses argparse and requires a minimum of three 
# commandline arguments.
#
# Example:
# $ python3 jobcron.py free-stuff -u 'https://westernmass.craigslist.org/search/zip?hasPic=1'
#
# The first argument is a short name for the results 
# message and database. Second argument is an email 
# address to send results to. For the third argument 
# at least one craigslist url must be entered. For best results
# I suggest applying filters on the Craigslist page so that url
# contains the most accurate search criteria. Each 
# url must be flagged -u and be in single quotes following a whitespace
#
# Example:
# -u 'http://*/*'
